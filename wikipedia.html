<p>Meena is the main character of the South Asian children's television show Meena. 
She was developed out of a need to confront the extreme discrimination against girls 
in South Asia.Her creation is partly due to the UNICEF, an organization that supports
the growing educational awareness of South Asia through Meena and her stories. 
Since her debut, she has made millions of girls and women aware about their rights 
as humans throughout the cartoon series. All of her stories advocate change in social
and cultural practices.</p>

        together with her parents and paternal grandmother, has a younger brother called
         Raju and a parrot called Mithu. Meena is like any ordinary rural girl
